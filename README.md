<h1>Object Spawner</h1>
 
 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcpgkjVf-rs)

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of a spawner script that allows users to customize the way the spawning works. This includes: the shape of the object, if the object has physics, the amount of objects, and finally the area that the objects can spawn in. Each shape has its own ShapeObject that defines what the shape is including: shape, color, and size. Both scripts have custom editors to make the process of defining these parameters more design friendly.
